==Google Reader Notifier Help==
<font size=3>
Google Reader Notifier is a Windows based system tray application that checks Google Reader for new items on a periodic basis. The application is set by default to run at startup.

*Check for new items*

    This menu option lets you select how often the notifier will check for new updates. If you have a smaller number of subscriptions, it may be useful to check more often. For a very large number of subscriptions, you will be notified constantly on new updates. It may be helpful to use the label filter in this case.

    You can manually trigger checking for new items by right-clicking on the icon and choosing Check Now:<br>

*Only display items with label*

    This textbox allows you to put a space delimited list of labels (folders, tags) that the notifier will filter by. If you have items in a folder called “favorites”, then putting favorites in this text box will make the notifier only alert you when there are updates to subscriptions in that folder. You could also put multiple folders by putting a space between them.

*Show count in Tooltip*

    When you hold your mouse over the tray icon, the unread count is normally displayed. If you wanted to turn this off, you can uncheck the checkbox. This is turned on by default.<br>

*Animate popup*

    When notifier detects new unread items, a popup animation similar to the Google Talk new mail notification is shown. You can uncheck this box if you want to disable that popup.<br>

*Start notifier when windows starts*

    The application is set by default to run at startup. If you wanted to turn this off, you can uncheck the checkbox.

*Browser to use*

    If you want to open google reader in a different browser than your system default one, choose one here. The list includes every browser installed on your system. 
        your choice will affect opening reader when you:<br>1. choose "Go To Reader" from right click menu.<br>2. double-click the systray icon<br>3. click on the text in notification popup window<br>

*Google Account Authentication*

    You should enter your Google Reader account login information here. The password will be saved in an encrypted file.

    If you forgot to fill a field, the login failed, or you're not connected to the Internet, an error icon will show up. Hover over it to see the error details in a tooltip.<br>
