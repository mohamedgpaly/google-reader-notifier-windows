Google Reader Notifier is a Windows based system tray application that checks Google Reader for new items on a periodic basis. The application is set by default to run at startup.

==Check for new items==

    This menu option lets you select how often the notifier will check for new updates. If you have a smaller number of subscriptions, it may be useful to check more often. For a very large number of subscriptions, you will be notified constantly on new updates. It may be helpful to use the label filter in this case.

    You can manually trigger checking for new items by right-clicking on the icon and choosing Check Now:<br>

==Only display items with label==

    version *1.0.8 and earlier*: This textbox allows you to put a space delimited list of labels (folders, tags) that the notifier will filter by. If you have items in a folder called “favorites”, then putting favorites in this text box will make the notifier only alert you when there are updates to subscriptions in that folder. You could also put multiple folders by putting a space between them.

    version *1.1.1 and later*: the textbox was replaced by an automatically generated list of lables. just choose the labels you want from the list, and it will only show items with that label. <br>
if you changed login information, click OK to close the Preferences window, then open it again to choose labels.

==Show count in Tooltip==

    When you hold your mouse over the tray icon, the unread count is normally displayed. If you wanted to turn this off, you can uncheck the checkbox. This is turned on by default.<br>

==Animate popup==

    When notifier detects new unread items, a popup animation similar to the Google Talk new mail notification is shown. You can uncheck this box if you want to disable that popup.<br>
